Multi-Language Translation
```diff 
- Under Development 👨‍💻🤖
```
I am planning to build a Multi Language Translator chat bot.
Characteristics
- Take in voice, chat or url as input
- Convert from one language to your required language
- specifying the langauage to be converted is only to be mentioned, automatic identification of the language and translation.
Use case
- Factories
- public place (tourist QA)
- A chatbot the language need not be mentioned everytime, and the bot can identify the language and convert to the needed language.
- this can also used for various applications, where the different language commands are been converted to english and the command is passed as command to the systen to achieve a task.
